# BruteForcePasswordCracker
Checks every possible password up to 11 characters. 

So this goes through every possible combination of characters until the inputted pasword matches. This would work on web sites that dont have a fire wall but you would have to make the lts(guess) input into the password input box on the website and a way to check if it was a good password.
